[Ranklib](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~vdang/ranklib.html)
Overview

RankLib is a library of learning to rank algorithms. Currently eight popular algorithms have been implemented:

＊MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees, a.k.a. Gradient boosted regression tree) [6]

＊RankNet [1]

＊RankBoost [2]

＊AdaRank [3]

＊Coordinate Ascent [4]

＊LambdaMART [5]

＊ListNet [7]

＊Random Forests [8]

With appropriate parameters for Random Forests, it can also do bagging several MART/LambdaMART rankers.
It also implements many retrieval metrics as well as provides many ways to carry out evaluation.
